THE AI-AHP DECISION AGENT: GUIDING WHERE B2B INNOVATION SHOULD GO NEXT
🏆 Winner – T.L. Saaty Decision-Making Hackathon (1st Place)

This project implements an AI-powered decision support agent built during a 24-hour hackathon.
The system integrates:

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

Analytic Network Process (ANP)

AI reasoning (conceptual GPT-based agent)

Automated visualization using Graphviz

The goal is to help organizations rapidly evaluate alternatives, generate weighted insights, and visualize complex decision structures.

⚡ Key Features

Automated pairwise comparison matrix generation

Consistency Ratio (CR) calculation

Supports AHP (hierarchical) & ANP (networked dependencies)

AI-assisted reasoning to recommend weights

Graphviz visualizations for decision networks

Final ranked alternatives with explanations

Clean, modular Python code for reuse

🧠 Project Inspiration

This system was inspired by our prior work on an AI Market Research Toolkit for manufacturing clients (Premier Labs), where we explored decision science + AI integration.

The hackathon solution expanded that concept into a full decision agent.
